# Solving-coefficents-of-matrices
In this repository there are two functions for solving matrices, the cramers rule and the Gauss-jordan row reduction

In both the two functions there are only two parameters
1. amat - This is the coefficient matrix
2. avec/bvec - This is the vector holding the solutions of the system of linear equations used to create the coefficent matrix
